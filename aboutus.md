Yinan Yu is an Assistant Professor in the functional programming research group at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. Her current research interests are automated machine learning (AutoML) and neural architecture search (NAS) from both a theoretical perspective and the viewpoint of industrial use cases, such as smart manufacturing and automotive perception systems. She is also the co-founder of two AI startup companies working with automated annotation for large volumes of data and AI as A Service, respectively. The purpose of her research is to bridge theoretical findings and industrial applications with sustainable and interpretable AI.

Stefan Candefjord is an Assistant Professor in the Biomedical electromagnetics research group at the Department of Electrical Engineering. His research project aims at improving the prehospital care process for victims in road traffic accidents. To minimize the consequences for the victims appropriate treatment must be given as soon as possible. This puts high demands on using effective tools in the prehospital setting to optimize the workflow and quickly decide on treatment. The work is carried out within the reserach centres MedTech West and SAFER.
